//A huge-ass to-do list for later:
/*Initialization
Probably will make the whole thing in Javascript, partially for practice. Might make it easier to loop, who knows.
A Title, A descriptor, and a start button.
Has a 'High Scores' button to indicate past attempts
    Sorted in order of score, perhaps
*/

/*The Quiz - Begins when start button pressed
Create question, make the timer appear and tick down, and also a bunch of possible answers
    Make a function for the timer and its functions
    Perhaps add a spot in the code to pull question and answer sets from
        Answers oughta be 3 wrong answers and 1 right answer... how do I randomize the options?
        Questions shouldn't repeat, but they need to be randomized too... hmm.
    If correct answer pressed, add a point. If wrong answer pressed, deduct time from the timer.
        Perhaps add fancy 'point added' and 'time deducted' labels that fade away?
Once timer hits 0, quiz ends, terminate operation
*/

/*The Evaluation - Begins when Quiz finishes
Change website page to note the score obtained
    Perhaps also add a 'questions answered correctly' value?
Allows input of high score and saves it in the local directory so it persists after refresh
    Only able to save the high score once, no need for leaderboard spam
Whether saved high score or not, have a button to loop back to initialization stage
